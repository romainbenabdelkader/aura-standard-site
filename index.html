AURA
====

Open Standard for Verifiable Proof of Origin (European-compatible)  
Public Draft v0.1 — Specification coming soon

AURA is an open standard that defines how to declare and verify the origin of digital assets (audio, video, image, text, datasets, AI outputs) in a way that is cryptographically verifiable and interoperable across platforms and institutions.

---

What is AURA?
-------------

AURA provides a neutral, open and machine-readable framework for:

- Declaring the origin of digital works at the moment of creation  
- Verifying integrity and provenance independently  
- Exposing transparent signals for lawful use, including AI training and TDM rights  

AURA is designed as an infrastructure layer for trust, not as a product, service or platform.

---

Scope & Principles
------------------

- Proof of origin at creation time, not after the fact  
- Cryptographic integrity (hash-based verification)  
- Verifiable timestamps  
- Separation between the standard (AURA) and implementations (services, products, platforms)  
- Alignment with European regulatory frameworks, including AI Act, TDM opt-out and copyright  

---

What AURA does (and does not do)
--------------------------------

✅ **AURA does**

- Provide a structured manifest for origin, rights and integrity  
- Enable independent verification of origin and integrity  
- Expose machine-readable transparency signals for AI training and TDM rights  

❌ **AURA does not**

- No content recognition or fingerprinting database  
- No DRM, no playback or usage control  
- No decision-making on licensing terms or remuneration  

AURA defines how provenance is declared and verified, not how content is monetized or controlled.

---

Governance
----------

AURA is published as an open Public Draft.  
Its objective is to converge toward formal standardization with an independent standardization body (European or international).

Implementations (such as proof-of-origin services) remain fully independent and interoperable, as long as they comply with the AURA specification.

---

Why Europe needs AURA
---------------------

The European Union holds specific competences in the fields of:

- Culture  
- Copyright  
- Audiovisual creation  
- Protection of cultural diversity  

With the emergence of artificial intelligence, generative systems and large-scale content transformation, the questions of origin, authorship and lawful use of works have become strategic issues for Europe.

AURA is designed as a European-compatible open standard that enables:

- Verifiable proof of origin for human, hybrid and AI-generated works  
- Machine-readable transparency signals for AI training and TDM rights  
- Interoperability between platforms, collecting societies and public institutions  
- Auditability and legal traceability across borders  

AURA does not replace national or European regulations.  
It provides a technical and legal interoperability layer compatible with existing European frameworks, including:

- Copyright law  
- Transparency obligations  
- Emerging AI regulation

License
-------

The AURA standard is released under the Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license suitable for institutional and industrial adoption.

Get involved
------------

The work on AURA is iterative.  
Feedback from:

- Creators  
- Collecting societies  
- Platforms  
- AI actors  
- Regulators  

is welcome.

- Open issues and proposals via the GitHub repository  
- Contributions to the manifest and interoperability profiles
