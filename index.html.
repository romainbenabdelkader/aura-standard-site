      <h2>What is AURA?</h2>
      <p>
        AURA is an open standard that defines how to declare and verify the origin of digital assets
        (audio, video, image, text, datasets, AI outputs) in a way that is cryptographically verifiable
        and interoperable across platforms and institutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scope & Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Origin proof at the moment of creation, not after the fact.</li>
        <li>Cryptographic integrity (hash) and verifiable timestamps.</li>
        <li>Separation between the standard (AURA) and implementations (services, products).</li>
        <li>Alignment with European frameworks (AI Act, TDM opt-out, copyright).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

        <div>
          <h3>Does</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a structured manifest for origin, rights and integrity.</li>
            <li>Enable independent verification of origin and integrity.</li>
            <li>Expose machine-readable signals for AI training and TDM rights.</li>

            <li>No DRM, no playback control.</li>

      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>
        AURA is published as an open <strong>Public Draft</strong>. The objective is to
        converge towards formal standardization with an independent body
        (e.g. European or international standardization organizations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations (such as proof-of-origin services) remain fully independent and
        interoperable as long as they comply with the AURA specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>
        The AURA standard is released under the <strong>Apache License 2.0</strong>,
        a permissive open-source license suitable for institutional and industrial adoption.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Get involved</h2>
      <p>
        The work on AURA is iterative. Feedback from creators, collecting societies,
        platforms, AI actors and regulators is welcome.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open issues and proposals on the GitHub repository.</li>
        <li>Contribute to the manifest and interoperability profiles.</li>
      </ul>
